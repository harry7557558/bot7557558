Endnotes
In this essay, I am defining Elsa and Anna as Disney princesses because audiences readily recognize them as such. They come from royalty, are designed with the princess aesthetic in mind, and meet all of the criteria necessary for an official coronation ceremony. I am aware that Frozen has its own product line separate from the Disney Princess brand to which all other princesses now subscribe and that they have not yet had their official "coronation ceremony" and product roll out at Walt Disney World. However, this is due to financial reasons-the Frozen line earns more money as a separate entity-rather than creative ones. It does not impact their identity as princesses within their own film-or in audiences' minds-and as such they wield all the rhetorical power of their princess predecessors.

In addition to Vanellope and Elsa, Disney also recently released a Marvel animated feature, Big Hero 6 , that follows the story of Baymax, a nurse-bot who works to help his "patient," Hiro Hamada, cope with depression resulting from his brother's sudden death in a fire. Although Disney rarely ever releases sequels (the last one was The Rescuers Down Under in 1990), Wreck It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6 will all be seeing sequels by 2020, reinforcing the popularity of all three of Disney's new disability representations.

I use the term "normate" throughout the essay to refer to the able-bodied community. The word was coined by Rosemary Garland-Thomson in her foundational work Extraordinary Bodies: Figuring Physical Disability in American Culture and Literature and is meant to draw attention to the social construction of the term "normal" as well as the underlying prejudices the word implies.

Although Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016) are both realistic representations of disability as a shared experience, these films are a product of Disney's subsidiary, Pixar, which has always done more to push the envelope than the Disney corporation's main branch. My intention in this paper is to focus on Walt Disney studios themselves, so I intentionally omitted these films.

Ralph's age and storyline (He's going through a mid-life crisis after spending the last 30 years as the villain of his game) both speak to an older audience similar to that of Pixar's The Incredibles . In addition, there are numerous references to video games from the 80s and 90s meant to appeal to an older, primarily male audience.

Most of Disney's attempts to encode race have, unfortunately, failed due to the latent (or blatent) racism these characters represent. The lead crow in Dumbo , named Jim (a distasteful reference to the Jim Crow laws of the South), embodies stereotypes of black men as lazy, out of work, and also associated with mysticism when they give Dumbo a "magic" feather. Song of the South employs similar stereotypes through the characters of Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear.

Elsa's use of this term in particular is ironic, considering how crazy has been used as a derogatory term for the mentally disabled, as Margaret Price has noted. Price has, at the same time, made a compelling argument as to why the community needs to take back the term; however that does not appear to be what is happening in this scene.

All of Disney's princesses have a "want song" that articulates their heart's most secret desire. Although most early princesses sing about finding a prince to marry later princesses express a desire to explore or to be who they really are.

Lori Merish argues in her essay "Cuteness and Commodity Aesthetics: Tom Thumb and Shirley Temple," that the cute aesthetic as modern audiences recognize it actually began with the "kid shows" of the mid-1800's where audiences would flock to gawk at Little People performing in an aggrandized style as generals, counts, and princesses. In particular, the wedding of Tom Thumb to Lavinia Warren was marketed as both adorable and innocent (190-5).

It was Fred Moore, one of the supervising animators on Disney's first feature-length production, Snow White , who first introduced the cute aesthetic to the Disney team. According to his colleagues, Moore himself had "proportions [that] were cute, like his drawings, and it kind of tickled you to watch him moving around" (Thomas and Johnston 120).

As Tom Shakespeare argues, "Disabled people often experience major disadvantages as a result of their genetic endowment, whereas members of other historically oppressed communities experience either minimal or non-existent biological disadvantages" (31).

Captain Nemo took the Sun's altitude
I was ready to set out
Conseil seized his gun
All fell on their knees in an attitude of prayer
A terrible combat began
"A man! A shipwrecked sailor!" I cried
The _Nautilus_ was floating near a mountain
The _Nautilus_ was blocked up
One of these long arms glided through the opening The unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly

[Illustration] All fell on their knees in an attitude of prayer The grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground, which formed a slight mound. When this was done, Captain Nemo and his men rose; then, approaching the grave, they knelt again, and all extended their hands in sign of a last adieu. Then the funeral procession returned to the Nautilus, passing under the arches of the forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on the ascent. At last the light of the ship appeared, and its luminous track guided us to the Nautilus. At one o'clock we had returned. As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the platform, and, a prey to conflicting emotions, I sat down near the binnacle. Captain Nemo joined me. I rose and said to him:

BCELoss ¶
class  torch.nn. BCELoss ( weight = None , size_average = None , reduce = None , reduction = 'mean' ) [source] ¶
ℓ ( x , y ) =  L =  { l  1 ​ , … , l  N ​ }  ⊤ , l  n ​ =  − w  n ​ [ y  n ​ ⋅ lo g x  n ​ + ( 1 − y  n ​ ) ⋅ lo g ( 1 − x  n ​ ) ] ,
ℓ ( x , y ) =  {  mean ( L ) ,  sum ( L ) , ​  if reduction = 'mean';  if reduction = 'sum'. ​
Parameters :
weight
.
size_average
reduce
reduction
Shape:
Examples:
>>> m  =  nn . Sigmoid ()  >>> loss  =  nn . BCELoss ()  >>> input  =  torch . randn ( 3 ,  requires_grad = True )  >>> target  =  torch . empty ( 3 ) . random_ ( 2 )  >>> output  =  loss ( m ( input ),  target )  >>> output . backward ()

$$\frac{\delta K^{-1}}{\delta p} = -K^{-1}\frac{\delta K}{\delta p}K^{-1}$$
$$\frac{\delta K^{-1}}{\delta p} = -K^{-2}\frac{\delta K}{\delta p}=-K^{-T}K^{-1}\frac{\delta K}{\delta p}$$
